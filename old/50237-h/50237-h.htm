<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>This little book should be used as a simple guide to
the practical study of Nature rather than as a mere reader.</p>
<p>Every lesson herein set down has, during the author&rsquo;s
many years&rsquo; experience in teaching Nature Study, been
taught by observation and practice again and again; and
each time with satisfactory result. The materials
required for most of the lessons&mdash;whether they be obtained
from the naturalist-dealer or from the nearest hedge,
ditch, or pond&mdash;are within everybody&rsquo;s reach.</p>
<p>There is nothing that appeals to the heart of the
ordinary child like <i><b>living things</b></i>, be they animal or
vegetable, and there is no branch of education at the
present day that bears, in the young mind, such excellent
fruit as the study of the simple, living things around us.</p>
<p>Your child is nothing if not curious. He wants to
understand everything that lives and moves and has its
being in his bright little world.</p>
<p>Nature Study involves so many ingenious little deductions,
that the reasoning powers are almost constantly
employed, and intelligence grows proportionately. The
child&rsquo;s powers of observation are stimulated, and his
memory is cultivated in the way most pleasing to his
inquiring nature. By dissecting seeds, bulbs, buds, and
flowers, his hand is trained, and methods expeditious
and exact are inculcated. By drawing his specimens,
no matter how roughly or rapidly, his eye is trained
more thoroughly than any amount of enforced copying
of stiff, uninteresting models of prisms, cones, etc., ever
could train it.</p>
<p>The love of flowers and animals is one of the most
commendable traits in the disposition of the wondering
child, and ought to be encouraged above all others.</p>
<p>It is the author&rsquo;s fondest and most sanguine hope that
the working out of the exercises, of which this booklet
is mainly composed, may prove much more of a joy than
a task, and that the practical knowledge gained thereby
may tempt his little readers to study further the great
book of Nature, whose broad pages are ever open to us,
and whose silent answers to our manifold questions are
never very difficult to read.</p>

<h1 title="">&ldquo;LOOK ABOUT YOU.&rdquo;
<br /><span class="small">BOOK III.</span></h1>
<h2 id="c1">I.&mdash;BIRDS IN WINTER.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;When we look out there, it makes us feel thankful
that we have a nice cosy room to play in and a warm fire
to sit beside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Uncle George who spoke. His two nephews,
Frank and Tom, stood at the window watching the birds
feeding outside, while Dolly, their little sister, was busy
with her picture-blocks on the carpet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is better to be inside in winter,&rdquo; said Frank,
the elder boy. &ldquo;These poor little birds must have a hard
time out in the cold all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not mind being a bird during the rest of
the year, though,&rdquo; said little Tom. &ldquo;It must be so jolly
to be able to fly wherever you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George smiled, and said, &ldquo;Birds are very happy
little creatures, Tom, but they have many enemies. Their
lives are in constant danger. They must always be on
the look-out for cats, hawks, guns, and cruel boys. Those
birds that stay with us all the year round have often a
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
hard fight for life in winter-time. In fact, many of
them starve to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of our birds fly to warmer countries in autumn,
and come back to us in spring. These miss the frost
and snow, but a great number of them get drowned
while crossing the sea. I think, as a little boy, you are
much better off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see; have you put out any food for the
birds this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Uncle George, we have done exactly as you
told us,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;Mother made a little net, which
we filled with suet and scraps of meat for the tomtits.
We hung it on the ivy, quite near the window. We
also put plenty of crumbs and waste bits from the
kitchen on the space you cleared for the birds yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;and I see your
feathered friends are busy in both places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked out and saw a crowd of birds hopping
on the frozen lawn round the well-filled dish. The
little net, which hung just outside the window, was
alive with hungry tomtits. They pecked eagerly at
the suet, and chattered their thanks between every
mouthful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lot of birds we have to-day,&rdquo; Uncle George
remarked. &ldquo;Do you know the names of them all,
boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know those you pointed out to us yesterday,&rdquo;
said Frank. &ldquo;There is the chaffinch, the thrush, the
greenfinch, the blackbird, and the hedge-sparrow, but
I don&rsquo;t know that one with the bright red breast, black
velvet head, and grey wings. And there is a new one
among the tomtits. He has a very long tail, and is
like a small parrot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/illus11.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="729" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;the first you spoke of is
the bullfinch. He is so easily tamed that he makes a
splendid pet. The hen bullfinch is there too, I see.
She has a dull brown breast, and is not quite so
pretty as her husband. The bullfinch is very fond of
berries. If we could get some hawthorn or rowan
berries, we should have all the bullfinches in the
district around us. The other bird is the long-tailed
tit. He is also a very amusing little chap.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/illus12.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="360" />
<p class="caption">Bullfinches.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why do the tomtits make such a fuss about the
suet?&rdquo; asked Tom. &ldquo;The bullfinches do not come
near it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is because the tomtit is a flesh-eater, Tom.
He lives on insects. The bullfinch feeds on berries
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
and seeds. He is also blamed for eating the young
buds of fruit-trees in spring-time, but I am not quite
sure that he does this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are all the insects in winter, Uncle
George?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, most of them are buried deep in the ground.
Some of them are tucked up in warm cases, and hidden
in the chinks of trees and walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t the birds that feed on insects
search those trees and walls for them,&rdquo; Frank asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the birds do, but the sleeping insects are very
hard to find. The cases which hold them are often
coloured exactly like the tree or wall which they are
fixed to; so that even the sharp eyes of a hungry bird
cannot see them.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Exercises on Lesson I.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. Write out the names of all the wild birds you have seen.</dt>
<dt>2. Some of these we do not see in winter. How is this?</dt>
<dt>3. Why should we remember the birds in winter-time?</dt>
<dt>4. Describe the robin. How does he differ from the bullfinch?</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 id="c2">II.&mdash;SEED-EATERS AND INSECT-EATERS.</h2>
<p>The snow did not go away for some days. While
it lasted, Frank and Tom watched the birds very
closely. They learned many new and curious things
about them.</p>
<p>The sparrows and robins had grown so tame that
they would fly right up to the window-sill, and eat the
crumbs and seeds that were placed there for them;
while the tomtits paid great attention to the little net
bag that hung quite close
to the window. So long
as they stood back a
short distance from the
window, the two boys
could watch the funny
tricks of these hungry
little visitors.</p>
<p>Amongst other things,
they learned to tell a
seed-eating bird from one
that feeds on insects.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/illus14.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="568" />
<p class="caption">Tomtits.</p>
</div>
<p>Seed-eating birds, as
their uncle told them,
have short, stout, hard
bills, just the thing for shelling seeds. The insect-eaters
have longer and more slender bills; while birds
that live upon both seeds and insects have bills hard
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
enough to shell seeds and yet long and sharp enough
to pick insects out of their hiding-places.</p>
<p>So many birds came to the feast, that Uncle George
cleared the snow from another part of the lawn and
spread some dry ashes upon it. Upon one patch he
scattered seeds and crumbs, and on the other he placed
a large flat dish.</p>
<p>In this dish were put all sorts of waste scraps from
the kitchen, such as bones,
potatoes, and pieces of
meat. Uncle George did
this so that the boys could
tell flesh-eating birds from
those that lived upon
seeds.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/illus15.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="333" />
<p class="caption">Starling.</p>
</div>
<p>The starlings came to
the dish first, and fought
among themselves for the
food, although there was
much more than enough for them all.</p>
<p>Then came a few rooks, who walked about the
dish in quite a lordly way. Every now and again one
of them would seize a huge crust of bread or a potato
in his clumsy bill and fly with it a short distance away.
The starlings, thrushes, and blackbirds hopped nimbly
about, picking up a choice morsel here and there.</p>
<p>The new patch was often crowded with finches of
all kinds. The boys noticed that many of the birds fed
at both places. Among these were sparrows, robins,
chaffinches, thrushes, and starlings. These birds, their
uncle explained to them, fed on a mixed food of insects,
seeds, and fruits.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>It amused them very much to watch how the rooks
and jackdaws always dragged the food away from the
dish, as if they were stealing it; while now and then a
blackbird would fly away with a loud chatter, as if he
had been suddenly found out whilst doing something
very wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These birds,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;are looked
upon as enemies by farmers and gardeners. They are
scared out of our fields and gardens by every possible
means. That is what makes them steal even the food
that is given to them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/illus16.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="277" />
<p class="caption">Rook.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;But they pick the newly-sown seeds out of the
ground, and steal the fruit when it is ripe,&rdquo; said Frank.
&ldquo;That is what the gardener says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the gardener only knew how much they help
him, by eating up the grubs and beetles that damage
his plants, he would not grudge them a few seeds and
berries, Frank,&rdquo; Uncle George replied. &ldquo;The rook is
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
one of the farmer&rsquo;s best friends; and if it were not for
thrushes, starlings, blackbirds, and such insect-eating
birds, our gardens would be overrun with insects. If
these insects were allowed to increase, we should not
be able to grow anything. Even the sparrow is the
gardener&rsquo;s friend. He eats the caterpillars that would
spoil our fruit trees and bushes.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c3">III.&mdash;BUDS.</h2>
<p>Uncle George and the two boys had been for a long
walk. They brought home a lot of twigs which they
had cut from trees at the roadside.</p>
<p>Uncle George placed some of these twigs in bottles
filled with water. These bottles were placed in the
window, so that they could get plenty of sunlight. The
rest of the twigs were laid upon the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;we are going to
find out what buds are. Here is a twig of the horse-chestnut
tree, and here is one of the beech tree. Do
you notice any difference between them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;they are very different. The
beech buds are longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; his uncle asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horse-chestnut buds have sticky stuff all over
them,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;On the beech
twig the buds are placed singly on opposite sides. On
the horse-chestnut twig the buds are in pairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Uncle George cut one of the buds through
with his knife, and they saw that a great number of
thick scales were folded round a little green thing in
the centre. They saw also a mass of woolly stuff between
the scales and the little green object.</p>
<p>Uncle George gave each of the boys a twig, and
showed them how to take the scales off the top bud
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
with a large needle. The outside scales were not easily
removed. They were so sticky&mdash;they stuck to everything
that touched them, and soon the boys&rsquo; fingers
were covered with the sticky stuff. As they went on
with their work, they found out that the inner scales
were not sticky. At last they got all the scales off, and
there was nothing left but a tiny woolly mass. On
teasing out, this woolly bundle was found to be a little
branch bearing small leaves. Every part of it was
covered with wool.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/illus19.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="442" />
<p class="caption">Twigs of Beech and Chestnut, showing Buds.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;you can perhaps tell
me what a bud is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just a little baby branch, snugly tucked up in
a tiny blanket and well covered over with many scale-leaves,&rdquo;
said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;Now tell me
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
why it is tucked up in this warm blanket, and perhaps
Tom can tell us what the sticky stuff on the outer
scales is for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I cannot tell,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think,&rdquo; said his uncle kindly. &ldquo;Why did
you call it a <i><b>baby</b></i> branch? Is it because it is so small,
or because it is so snugly wrapped up? Why are babies
wrapped up in soft warm clothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know now,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;The woolly stuff is
to keep out the winter cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the sticky stuff on the outside,&rdquo; said Tom,
&ldquo;must be for keeping out the rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are both right,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;Buds are
formed in autumn and early winter. They are, as you
have seen, very tender little things. Frost or wet
would kill them. But rolled up in soft woolly clothing,
covered in with many thick scale-leaves, and made quite
waterproof by a thick coat of the sticky stuff, they do
not fear the cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you look at your twigs again, you will find that
in taking off the scales you have left a thick ring of
marks right round the twig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if you look down the twig, you will notice
another ring of such marks. These are the scale-marks
of last year&rsquo;s bud. The part of the twig
in between these two ring marks is a year&rsquo;s
growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a third ring on mine farther down the
stem,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and another farther down still,&rdquo; said Uncle
George. &ldquo;These are the bud marks of former years.
Let us measure the distance between them, for in this
way we can tell the kind of summers we have had in
past years.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Last year&rsquo;s growth, you see, is two inches. The
growth of the year before is three inches, and the one
beneath that is four and a half inches. This tells us
that there was very little sunshine during last summer
or the summer before, and that three years ago there
was a warm summer, causing much
growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see some other strange marks
on the twig,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean the horse-shoe
marks. These are the scars left by
the big green leaves which fell off
in autumn. You will find one of
these curious horse-shoe marks
under each bud.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/illus25.jpg" alt="" width="321" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Hawthorn Twigs.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a hawthorn twig. I
brought it to let you see another
way in which plants protect their
buds. In the hawthorn the buds
usually occur in pairs together. Between each pair of
buds there is a long sharp thorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reason why every pair of buds is guarded in
this way is very clear. The horse-chestnut and beech
have tall, stout stems, which rear up their branches
far out of the reach of grazing animals. The hawthorn
is a low growing tree. Its branches are within easy
reach, and its tender buds would be nipped off by
sheep and cattle if it were not for these sharp thorns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thorns also prevent the buds from being
knocked off by anything rubbing against the hawthorn
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
hedge. You will notice that each thorn is very much
longer than the buds beside it. These thorns can give
a very cruel prick, as every boy knows who has tried
to cut a twig from the hawthorn hedge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By and by we shall see that there are many plants
which arm themselves against animals in this way.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c4">IV.&mdash;A BABY PLANT.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;we are going to try
to find out something about seeds.&rdquo; And he placed
upon the table a saucerful of beans which had been
soaking in water for two days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First let us look at the seeds as they are when
we get them from the shop,&rdquo; he said, laying a handful
of hard, wrinkled beans upon the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are as hard as stones, and very much
smaller than those we soaked,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is one thing we have learned about
them already. Seeds take in water and swell greatly.&rdquo;
As he spoke, Uncle George gave Frank, Tom, and
Dolly each a small knife and a needle mounted in a
handle. He then laid a small magnifying glass on the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a soaked bean and look at it well,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;First we will look at the outside of it, then we will
see what it has inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My bean is covered all over with a smooth skin,&rdquo;
said Dolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is a long black mark on one side of it,&rdquo;
Tom added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Frank,&rdquo; said his uncle, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you
got something to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is sort of kidney-shaped,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing more?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Frank shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeeze it,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;and tell me what
you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there is water oozing out of a little hole at
the end of the black mark,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shows us that the seed is not quite covered
by its skin,&rdquo; said their uncle. &ldquo;That little hole is
there to allow a tiny root to grow out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let us remove the skin, or skins rather, for
there are two of them. Begin as far away from the
black mark as you can. You see that the outer skin
is tough like leather, while the inner one is soft and
silky. Now, if you pull the skins off gently, you will
find something like a stout little root pointing towards
the little hole you have already noticed. If you look
at the edge of the seed you will notice a thin line or
crack. Putting the knife into this crack, we find that
the seed consists chiefly of two large, flat, white parts
or lobes, with a very small object in between them.
Let us remove one of these white masses, and have a
look at this small object with the glass.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/illus28.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="199" />
<p class="caption">Seed of Runner Bean.<br />(1) outside; (2) inside; (3) baby plant, enlarged.<br /><i>a</i>, shoot; <i>b</i>, root; <i>c</i>, seed coat or skin; <i>d</i>, junction of seed-leaves.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Each of the children had a look through the glass
in turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;it is very like what we found
inside the horse-chestnut bud. I can see two tiny
leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remove the little object on the point of your
needle and look at it again,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;It
has got something that your little horse-chestnut shoot
did not have, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a little thing like a root,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a little plant with a very fat little root,&rdquo;
said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just what it is,&rdquo; said his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has every seed got a little plant inside it, Uncle
George?&rdquo; Dolly asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every seed, Dolly, no matter how small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George split up one of the hard seeds that
had not been soaked, and showed them a little plant
of the same kind inside; but it was so hard and brittle
that he could crumble it up into powder between his
fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are the two large white lobes for?&rdquo;
asked Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the seed-leaves. They are stores of
plant-food. The young plant is fed by these until its
root grows far down into the soil and its shoot grows
high up into the air&mdash;until it is old enough and strong
enough to find food for itself, in fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the bud, the little shoot is fed by the sap of
the mother-plant. Here, in the seed, we have a baby
plant wrapped up in two coats, one thick and leathery
and the other soft and warm; and, in place of a large
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
feeding-bottle, there are two huge masses of plant-food
wrapped up with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do we put seeds in the ground to make
them grow?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A seed requires three things to make it grow.
These three things are&mdash;<i>water</i>, <i>air</i>, and <i>warmth</i>. We
can grow seeds without soil at all if we give them
these three things. But if either water, air, or warmth
be wanting, your seeds cannot grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why seeds won&rsquo;t grow outside in winter,
then,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the reason,&rdquo; his uncle answered. &ldquo;In
winter there is not enough heat to make seeds grow.
If you sow seeds in a pot of dry soil in summer, and
do not give them water, they will not grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think a seed is a most wonderful thing,&rdquo; said
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;wonderful indeed. The
most wonderful thing about it is that there is life in it&mdash;sleeping
life, awaiting these three things I have told
you about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dried up, and as hard as a stone, it will keep for
years; but when air, warmth, and moisture are given
it, it springs into life and becomes a plant, which
grows, produces seeds, and dies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, we will plant the rest of the soaked beans&mdash;not
in ground, for I want to let you see that the seed-leaves
contain far more food than the tiny plant requires
to feed it until it is old enough to take care of
itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will plant these seeds in damp sawdust, from
which they can get no food. We will see that they
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
get water, air, and warmth, but no food except what
is in the big seed-leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George then got a box filled with sawdust,
and placed the beans in it. He arranged them in
different ways. Some beans he placed edgeways, others
longways, others lying on their sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am doing this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to show you that, no
matter how a seed happens to lie in the soil, its root
will always grow down and its shoot will always
grow up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then covered them up with a thin layer of sawdust,
and placed the box in a warm corner of the
kitchen. The boys promised to water the seeds every
day, and to watch them as they grew.</p>

<h2 id="c5">V.&mdash;HOW A PLANT GROWS.</h2>
<p>Every day the boys watched their buds and seeds
bursting into life.</p>
<p>It was slow work; but, as winter passed slowly away
and they were able to go out for walks more often, they
had much to amuse them. They brought home all sorts
of curious things, and soon had quite a host of living
things to watch.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/illus32.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="363" />
<p class="caption">Four Stages in the opening of Horse-Chestnut Buds.</p>
</div>
<p>Three weeks passed before the horse-chestnut buds
showed any signs of opening. By this time they had
swelled out very much. First the sticky scales moved
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
apart, then folded themselves backwards out of the way,
and at last fell off altogether.</p>
<p>This moving apart of the scales was caused by the
shoot or branch inside the bud, which was growing
rapidly.</p>
<p>Before the scales fell off, it had burst its way through
them. It was now a large mass of thick leaves all
folded together, and covered all over with a sort of
wool.</p>
<p>Soon these thick leaves moved apart, the woolly
covering came off, and what a month ago was a little
woolly body, so tiny that it had to be picked apart with
a needle, was now a large stout branch, smooth and
green, and bearing beautiful broad leaves.</p>
<p>Some of the buds brought forth small clusters of
little green balls. These the boys at first thought were
berries, but they afterwards found out that they were
flowers.</p>
<p>After all the buds had quite opened out, they began
slowly to wither. Uncle George told them the reason
of this. It was because the branch had been cut away
from the mother-tree, which drew its food from the soil
and air.</p>
<p>The growing buds had used up all the sap which
the cut branch contained.</p>
<p>But by the time their twigs had withered, the buds
outside had began to open&mdash;for spring was now at
hand.</p>
<p>The hedges were becoming greener every day. The
birds were heard singing in the woods, and little
green shoots were springing up everywhere under foot.</p>
<p>Frank and Tom brought home opening buds of all
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
kinds, and watched the hedges and trees as they walked
daily to school.</p>
<p>Two of the bean seeds were dug up out of the sawdust
every second or third day. In this way the boys
were able to see exactly how a bean plant grows from
seed.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/illus34.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="471" />
<p class="caption">Stages in the Germination of the Runner Bean.<br />In 1 and 4, inside of seed, growing baby plant is shown.</p>
</div>
<p>First the seed swells out; then the skin bursts, and
the little plant in between the two masses of plant-food
begins to grow.</p>
<p>The root always grows down straight. The little
shoot always grows upwards.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>After the root has grown about an inch it begins
to branch; and in about two weeks these branch
branch-roots are searching the soil for food all around
the main root.</p>
<p>The shoot meanwhile is growing in length and
thickness. It remains folded up until it reaches the
air and light. Then its leaves open out and turn from
a creamy colour to bright green.</p>
<p>One small box of seeds was placed in a dark cupboard.
These beans grew much more quickly than
those grown in the light; but they were pale, lank, and
sickly. They never turned green.</p>
<p>From this the boys learned that the green colour of
leaves and stems is due to the action of light.</p>
<p>Uncle George took a few grains of wheat and
placed them upon wet blotting-paper. A tumbler
turned upside down was placed over them.</p>
<p>In a few days the children saw that a few small
roots had grown out from the end of each grain.</p>
<p>When these roots had grown to about half an inch
in length, great tufts of long slender hairs sprang out
all round them near their tips. These, their uncle told
them, were &ldquo;root-hairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The root-hairs of a plant are so fine that they are
always torn off when we dig or pull a plant out of the
ground. It is by means of these slender root-hairs
that the plant is able to suck water out of the soil;
and this water always contains a very little plant-food
in it.</p>
<p>The boys noticed that the wheat grain did not
sprout in the same way as the bean seed. Instead of
one stout little root, three usually came out. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
tiny shoot seemed to grow from the <i>outside</i> of the
grain, and the two large masses of plant-food were
missing.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/illus36.jpg" alt="" width="344" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Stages in the Germination of Wheat.</p>
</div>
<p>Some wheat seeds were soaked
and cut down the middle. With
the aid of the glass, the boys
saw that in the wheat seed the
baby plant is attached to <i>one</i>
large mass of plant-food, made
up of flour with an outside layer
of bran.</p>
<p>Their uncle then told them
that all the flowering plants in
the world are of two great
families, namely, those whose
seeds have only one food store,
like the wheat grain, and those
whose seeds have two, like the bean.</p>

<h2 id="c6">VI.&mdash;MORE ABOUT SEEDS.</h2>
<p>It was raining in torrents outside, and the boys
were a little upset inside, for it was Saturday. They
always looked forward to Saturday, for it was their
great rambling day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we can&rsquo;t get out to-day,&rdquo; said Frank,
sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; said his uncle. &ldquo;But that is no
reason why we should sulk. We have those maize
seeds to look over, you know, and by the time we
have done that perhaps the rain will have stopped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Frank and Tom were bringing the boxes of
seeds, Uncle George and Dolly were busy getting out
knives, glasses, mounted needles, and the books they
made their notes and sketches in.</p>
<p>There were four small boxes in all. Each box had
been sown with maize or Indian corn at times a week
apart, so that the plants in one box were five weeks
old, in the next four weeks old, and so on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will begin as we did with the bean. Let us
cut the seed open first.&rdquo; As he spoke, Uncle George
laid some soaked maize seeds on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you look at these seeds carefully, you will
notice a large mark on one of the flat sides of each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;It is shaped something
like a cone, and its broad end is at the narrow end of
the seed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is lighter in colour than the rest of the seed,&rdquo;
said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are both right,&rdquo; said their uncle. &ldquo;Now I want
you to cut the seed longways, right down through
the middle of that mark. Then use your glass, and
tell me what you see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look closely,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;first into one
half and then into the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see something like a tiny plant,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;It is shut off from a great mass of what looks like
plant-food, just like our wheat grains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom made a rough sketch of it, and showed it to
his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the baby plant, and the great mass above
it is plant-food,&rdquo; said his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Frank. Don&rsquo;t let Tom do all the finding
out. What have you to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The maize seed has only one mass of plant-food,
and it does not seem to have two seed coats like the
bean,&rdquo; Tom replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Uncle George; &ldquo;but if you
look again you will see that there is a thick layer of
food stuff outside, which is of a different colour from
the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is like the bran layer which is round the
food store in the wheat grain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This food store is starch, or, as we call it,
<i>flour</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, let us look at the growing seeds. We will
take a few seeds out of each box and see how they
differ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The seeds in this box, the last sown, are just a
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
week old. You see the root and shoot are just
beginning to show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a sketch, drawing it as large as you can,
and write under it, &lsquo;Maize seed after a week&rsquo;s growth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the same with a seed from each of the other
three boxes, and when you have drawn them all, tell
me of any differences you notice between the growth
of maize and that of the bean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do not grow in the same way at all,&rdquo; said
Frank, as he drew his last sketch. &ldquo;In the maize
seed the baby plant seems to be stuck on to one of
the flat sides of the seed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the roots, Frank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I see that,&rdquo; Frank went on. &ldquo;The root
branches out all at once in the maize seed. In some
of these seeds the main root has scarcely grown at all.
Their roots are all branch-roots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, in the oldest plants, one great leaf rolls
round the shoot and hides it,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;In the
bean shoot we saw two leaves quite plainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, Tom. Now, boys, compare your drawings
with those you made of the bean. I will grow a
maize and a bean seed together, so that you can watch
the growth of both, and compare them day by day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George then got an empty pickle bottle, and
poured some water into it. Then he took a soaked
bean seed, and, having run a thread through it with a
needle, he hung it inside the bottle. He then corked
the bottle, and placed it in the window.</p>
<p>He next took an old lamp chimney, and made a roll
of blotting-paper to fit the inside of it. This roll of
paper was stuffed with moss. A few maize seeds were
pushed in between the glass and the paper, and the
lamp chimney was placed in a saucerful of water in the

<p>&ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;I want you to
watch these seeds every day. If you do so, you will
learn how a seed grows into a plant; and you will learn
this not from me, but from the plant itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George filled a wide bottle with water from
the tap, and fixed one of the five-week-old maize plants
in it by means of a split cork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to watch this plant growing,&rdquo; he said,
as he placed the bottle in the window. &ldquo;You ought to
draw it once a week. Most people think that plants
draw their food chiefly from the soil. This is a great
mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plants take most of their food from the air, as
you will see if you watch the growth of this plant. Of
course, it has a good food store in the seed; but I
think you will be surprised at the growth it makes
from that food store, the bottle of tap water, and
the air.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c7">VII.&mdash;THE HORSE POND IN SPRING.</h2>
<p>When Frank and Tom came home from school one
afternoon, they found their uncle very busy finishing
a net he had made of green gauze.</p>
<p>It had the shape of a shallow bag, and was fixed
to a stout wire ring. This ring was fastened to a
walking-stick with a piece of strong string.</p>
<p>On the table there were three wide glass jars, each
with a piece of cord
tied round the neck to
serve as a handle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Uncle
George, as he finished
tying the net to the
stick, &ldquo;now we are all
ready for a visit to that
pond of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img src="images/illus46.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="446" />
<p class="caption">Pond-Net and Glass Jars.</p>
</div>
<p>The pond was about
half a mile away, in the
corner of a field near a
wood. A small stream
ran out of it, and joined a larger one a short distance
away. The last time the boys had seen this pond it
was covered with ice, and they had a merry time skating
upon it. When they reached it on this afternoon,
it looked quite different. The grass around its banks
was fresh and green, and rushes were peeping up
through the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Uncle George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Croak, croak, cr-roak</i>&rdquo; came from beyond the
rushes, while here and there a little head would bob
up and down in the water.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/illus47.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="653" />
<p class="caption">Frog and Spawn in Water.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Frogs!&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>Uncle George nodded, and, stepping to the edge of
the pond, he pulled the net out, and with it a large
mass of what looked like clear jelly, having a large
number of black dots in it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bring the largest jar, Tom,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are
going to take this home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Uncle George?&rdquo; both boys asked at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a mass of frog&rsquo;s eggs, called the spawn of
the frog,&rdquo; their uncle replied. &ldquo;Now, Frank, hold the
jar over the water while I try to pour it in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no easy matter getting it into the jar. It
fell back into the pond several times before it was at
last got in the jar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Uncle George, as he placed the jar,
now filled with frog spawn, upon the bank. &ldquo;Now,
let us go to another part of the pond and look for
something else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quite still and look into the water. That is
the only way to study pond life. If you move about
you will see very little. Now tell me if you see anything
moving at the bottom of the pond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see things like little pieces of stick moving
slowly about,&rdquo; said Tom in a whisper; &ldquo;but perhaps
it is the water that is moving them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;They are
not pieces of stick. There is a living creature inside
each of them. We must have some of them, Tom.
They are very interesting creatures.&rdquo; And Uncle
George put his hand carefully down and picked
several of them up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are caddis &lsquo;worms,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Uncle George.
He placed them in the second jar, and filled it up with
water.</p>
<p>Tom then saw that each of the &ldquo;sticks&rdquo; was really
a little house, in which was an insect of some sort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The cases were built of all kinds of odds and ends,
glued together by the clever creatures that lived inside
them.</p>
<p>Some were built of little pieces of rush or water-weed,
others of tiny shells, and others of very small
stones.</p>
<p>Each case was open at one end, and from this end
the little dweller came almost half-way out. They could
see his head, his legs, and the fore part of his body as
he moved along, dragging his little house after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle George, come here please,&rdquo; Frank shouted
from the other side of the pond. &ldquo;Oh, such a funny
animal&mdash;a fish with legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fish with legs?&rdquo; said Uncle George, laughing.
&ldquo;Oh, we must come and see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that isn&rsquo;t a fish, Frank. It is a newt.&rdquo;
And Uncle George put in the net to catch him. But
the creature was too quick for him. It darted out of
sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are two others. Oh, such big ones,&rdquo; said
Tom, in a loud whisper.</p>
<p>This time Uncle George was luckier. When he
drew up the net there were two large creatures like
lizards in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a lucky find, boys,&rdquo; said their uncle.
&ldquo;Great crested newts, and what beauties they are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were surprised to see him take one of the
newts out of the net in his hand. He turned them over
and looked at them closely before putting them into
the jar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid they will bite you, Uncle George?&rdquo;
Tom asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, they cannot bite, and for a very good reason.
They have got no teeth. They are most harmless
creatures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must be getting home, boys. We have
done well for our first visit to the pond. I will tell you
all about what we have found when we get home, and
you must watch them closely for yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going to keep all these animals?&rdquo; Frank
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will keep them for a little while, so as to
find out what we can about them, then we will put
them in the pond again.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c8">VIII.&mdash;UNCLE GEORGE&rsquo;S TANK.</h2>
<p>Uncle George&rsquo;s tank was very simple. It was made
up of several large glass bells, such as the gardener
uses for covering tender plants.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig21">
<img src="images/illus51.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="315" />
<p class="caption">Uncle George&rsquo;s Aquarium.</p>
</div>
<p>Each glass bell had a nob on the end of it. Uncle
George got a large block of wood for each bell-jar.
This block he hollowed out with a chisel.</p>
<p>He next bored a large hole in the centre of the
hollow to hold the nob. Then he cut a piece of thick
green cloth into a round shape, with a hole in its
centre.</p>
<p>This piece of cloth was placed over the hollowed out
part of the block, and the bell-jar, turned upside down,
was placed in the block so that the glass nob fitted into
the hole.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Uncle George fitted up four of these tanks and filled
them with fresh water. The frog spawn was put into
the first vessel. The next was for the newts. The
third one held the caddis worms and some other
curious creatures that had been found in the ditch.</p>
<p>In the fourth vessel were half a dozen pretty little
fishes called stickle-backs, which the boys had caught
in the brook.</p>
<p>Some water weeds and a few water snails or whelks
were put into each vessel,
except that with the frog
spawn in it.</p>
<p>Every other morning
Uncle George changed
the water by means of a
tube which he called a
siphon.</p>
<p>This was a piece of
lead pipe, about two feet
long, and bent in the
middle into the form of
the letter U.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water weeds are
very pretty,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; replied his
uncle, &ldquo;and they are also
very useful. They help to
keep the water pure. I
should have to change
the water every day if there were no weeds in it.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig22">
<img src="images/illus52.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="751" />
<p class="caption">Stickle-backs, Pond Weed, etc., in Aquarium.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The whelks also are most useful. They are the
road-men of our ponds and streams. They eat up all
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
the waste matter, and so keep the water clean and
healthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was great fun feeding those little fishes. They
were fed sometimes on raw meat chopped very fine,
sometimes on little pieces of biscuit. At first they were
very shy, but they soon got over that. In less than a
week they were quite at home, and would come up to
the top of the water and take tiny pieces of beef from
the boys&rsquo; fingers.</p>
<p>They would swim after Frank&rsquo;s finger as he drew it
round the tank, and would even leap out of the water
for food that was held out to them.</p>
<p>At times they darted about as if playing &ldquo;hide and
seek&rdquo; among the water weeds.</p>
<p>By and by the boys noticed that every time one of
the little fish darted at another, the three cruel spines
rose up on his back, and that he was really trying to
spear his neighbour.</p>
<p>One morning a dead stickle-back was found in the
bottom of the tank. A few days later another little
fish was picked out pale and stiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are killing one another,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;What
shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any more of this fighting goes on we shall have
to put them back into the brook,&rdquo; said Uncle George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they always fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not always&mdash;only in spring-time when they are
mating. Look! there is one of them getting very pretty.
He is the victor&mdash;the bully of the pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us call him <i>Bully</i>,&rdquo; said Dolly; &ldquo;he is
bigger than the others, and oh, so much more
beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Next day another stickle-back was found dead, and
Bully&rsquo;s colours were much brighter. He darted about
as if the whole tank belonged to him.</p>
<p>He was really a lovely fish now, and he seemed to
know it by the proud way in which he dashed about,
showing off his fine slender body all shiny with crimson,
blue, and gold. He was, as Dolly said, &ldquo;Just like a
little bit of rainbow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before the evening a very curious thing took
place. Bully seemed to have suddenly lost all his fine
colours; and instead of swimming proudly at the top
of the tank, he slunk sulky to the bottom.</p>
<p>The strange thing was that <i>another</i> stickle-back&mdash;a
smaller fish than Bully&mdash;was now brightly coloured, and
seemed to be lord of the tank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully has been beaten,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;and
his victor has taken not only the courage but the colour
out of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It serves him right, I think, for being so proud and
so cruel. But what is the meaning of all this fighting
and change of colours, Uncle George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is very simple, Frank. There is a lady
stickle-back in the question; and, like the brave knights
of old, our little stickle-backs are trying to win her by
fighting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The victor will marry her. They will build a
neat little nest for themselves, and live happily
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow we will take them back to the
brook, where the weak ones will be better able to
escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In June we will visit the brook. If we are lucky
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
enough to find one of their nests, you will see that after
Lady Stickle-back lays her tiny eggs in it, her little
husband guards the home
night and day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the family are
hatching out, the plucky little
stickle-back bravely defends
the nest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He drives away water-beetles,
perch, and other fishes
much larger than himself.
For well he knows that these
visitors would quickly gobble
up his darlings if they got
the chance.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c9">IX.&mdash;TADPOLES.</h2>
<p>The frog spawn, when first put into the big glass
bell, was just a mass of jelly-like stuff studded all over
with black dots.</p>
<p>When looked at closely, it was seen to consist of
many round, clear eggs. Each egg was surrounded by
a thin skin, and had, in its centre, a little round black
ball or yolk.</p>
<p>At the end of a week all these black yolks had lost
their round shape. They were now long and oval.
During the next four days these oval yolks became
little moving animals, each having a head, body, and
tail, but no limbs.</p>
<p>From the head of each there grew out two pairs of
feathery objects. These, Uncle George told the boys,
were gills or breathing organs. Soon another pair of
these feathery gills appeared: so that each little creature
had now three on each side of his head.</p>
<p>By the end of the second week the little creatures
had all wriggled out of the eggs. They hung together
by their feathery gills in little black groups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we feed them on?&rdquo; Frank asked his
uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not at all nice in their tastes,&rdquo; Uncle
George replied. &ldquo;They will eat almost anything, from
water weeds up to drowned kittens. If they get nothing
else, they will eat one another, and not mind it a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;How dreadful,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better
give them something to eat now, for fear they may eat
each other up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do much good giving them anything
to eat now, for they have <i>no mouths</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig24">
<img src="images/illus57.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="416" />
<p class="caption">The Development of the Tadpole.<br />1. Portion of Frog Spawn. 2. Same after ten days. 3. A Newly-Hatched Tadpole. The remaining figures show the same Tadpole at (4) one week; (5) three weeks; (6) seven weeks; (7) eleven weeks; (8) thirteen weeks; and (9) fourteen weeks after hatching.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;No mouths, Uncle George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No mouths,&rdquo; Uncle George repeated. &ldquo;Is it not
curious? For four days the tadpole, or young frog,
has no mouth, and yet during that time he grows a
great deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four days after he leaves the egg his mouth
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
appears. It is a very small mouth, fringed with frilled,
fleshy lips. These lips are moved by a pair of strong,
horny jaws. This mouth is very different from the
wide, gaping mouth of the frog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as Uncle George had said, the tadpoles ate
nothing for four days. Then their mouths appeared,
and they began to eat the water weeds. But Uncle
George fed them on raw meat. He said it made them
grow quickly. A small piece of raw beef, tied to the
end of a string, was lowered into the tank, and the
tadpoles swarmed around it. What was left of the
beef was pulled out every morning, and a fresh piece
put in.</p>
<p>By this means the water was kept clean, and had
only to be changed once a week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they have no gills now,&rdquo; said Frank one
day, as he was helping his uncle to change the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, they have, Frank. They have gills like a
fish now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they are about four weeks old, their feathery
gills go away; but, before this, four gill-slits are formed
in each side of the tadpole&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George took a glass tube about twelve inches
long, and placing his thumb tightly on one end of it,
he pushed it down into the water until the other end
was right above a tadpole.</p>
<p>Then he took his thumb off, and the tadpole and
some water shot up the tube. He then replaced his
thumb tightly on the end of the tube, and lifted it out
of the water.</p>
<p>The tadpole and water remained in the tube as long
as he kept his thumb on the end of it. He emptied
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
the contents of the tube into a little dish, and Frank
looked at the tadpole with a glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see the gill-slits,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, you can, if you look closely. What seems
to be a big head is really head and body covered over
by a cloak of skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see the gills now,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;They are
red in colour. I also see the cloak. There is an
opening on the left side of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; said his uncle. &ldquo;That opening is
there to let the water into the gills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of the fifth week, Uncle George took
some tadpoles out for the boys to look at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see any change?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;they have two things like hind
legs growing out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These <i>are</i> legs,&rdquo; his uncle said, &ldquo;and in two
weeks from now these legs will have movable joints
in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Day by day the tadpoles were carefully watched,
and the following wonderful changes were observed.</p>
<p>When about seven weeks old, their hind legs became
jointed, and long toes were formed. The tadpoles were
now able to kick out and swim by means of their long
hind legs. Their gills went away, and they came to the
surface and took mouthfuls of air. They now had lungs
instead of gills.</p>
<p>But the most striking change came at the end of
the eleventh week.</p>
<p>One by one they lost the cloak which covered head
and body.</p>
<p>Under this cloak a pair of fore legs had been folded
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
up and hidden for some time. They were now tiny,
wide-mouthed frogs, with long, clumsy tails.</p>
<p>The clumsy tails grew smaller and smaller daily.
At last there was no tail left, and what was at one
time a cluster of black, wriggling tadpoles, was now a
crowd of lively little dark yellow frogs.</p>
<p>The boys wished to keep them longer, but their
uncle told them that they could not do this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your tadpoles are now frogs,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The frog
is an insect eater. As we cannot give these little frogs
their natural food, we must place them where they can
get it for themselves, or they will die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the frogs were carried back to their native pond.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c10">X.&mdash;FROGS, TOADS, AND NEWTS.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I think we had better take our newts back to the
pond now, Frank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do let us keep them for a day or two longer,
Uncle George. They are getting quite tame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Frank drew his finger slowly round
the outside of the glass vessel that held the newts.
One of the creatures swam round, following his finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Uncle George! He knows me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is hungry, and thinks you ought to have a
small worm in your fingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Thinks?</i> Uncle George. Can newts <i>think</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if they could, does it not? We feed
these creatures every day, and they have got into the
habit of looking for food every time we come near them.
But here comes Tom with the worms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was curious to watch how the newt acted when
a tiny worm was given it. At first it seemed not to
see the worm, although it was wriggling at his nose.
It crept back slowly about two or three inches, then
all at once it sprang upon the worm and gobbled
it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must tell us all about the newt, Uncle George,&rdquo;
said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to know how much you two boys
have found out by feeding and watching these two,&rdquo;
said Uncle George. &ldquo;So just tell me what <i>you</i> know
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
about the newt first, then perhaps I can tell you some
things about newts, frogs, and toads which you do not
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began Tom, &ldquo;the newt lives in water. He
has four feet, with pretty little toes upon them, and a
long tail. He feeds upon worms, tadpoles, and other
small animals, and he swallows them whole, because
he has no teeth.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig26">
<img src="images/illus64.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="510" />
<p class="caption">Crested Newt, Male and Female.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The male has a huge
crest, and is gay with
bright colours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The female has no
crest. She lays her eggs
upon the pond weeds. A
single egg is laid upon a
leaf. The leaf is then
rolled round it, so as to
hide it from enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Tom,&rdquo; said
his uncle; &ldquo;but you have
not told us about the newt&rsquo;s skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot that,&rdquo; Tom went on. &ldquo;The newt has
a lovely silky skin, which it only wears for about a
week, then it casts it off. Now, tell us something
more about them, Uncle George.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The newt does not live in the water all the year,&rdquo;
said Uncle George. &ldquo;During autumn and winter great
families of newts sleep together under stones and in
dry holes in the earth. They only go to the pond in
early spring to lay their eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do newts ever become frogs or toads?&rdquo; asked
Frank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Frank, never. I know what makes you
think that. It is because the young frog, just before
he loses his tail, is very like a little newt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young newts are tadpoles too, but they differ very
much from frog tadpoles. Newt tadpoles live in the
pond for more than a year. They have feathery outside
gills on all that time. Their <i>fore</i> feet are formed first.
If you remember, our frog tadpoles got their hind legs
first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long ago people believed all sorts of absurd things
about the poor, harmless newt. They were afraid to
touch it. Every newt found was killed at once, for it
was thought to have a sting and poison bag. Even at
the present day many people believe that newts and
toads are dangerous animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you tell a toad from a frog, Uncle George,&rdquo;
Tom asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are very different from each other, both in
shape and in their ways of living. The toad is a fat,
clumsy animal. His skin is dull and warty. He does
not hop, but crawls or walks lazily along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lives upon flying insects, which he catches with
his curious long tongue. He gets very fat during
summer and autumn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before winter comes on, he looks out a snug hole
under a root or stone. Here he sleeps the whole
winter through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In spring he wakes up, lean and hungry, and
betakes himself to the pond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eggs of the toad are laid in the water in long
strings, each like a double row of beads. They hang
gracefully upon the water weeds, and look very pretty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;The toad tadpoles are very like those of the frog.
They go through the same changes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The toad also casts his skin, but he does not throw
it away like the newt. He takes his old, cast-off skin,
rolls it up into a neat little ball, and <i>swallows it</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The frog&rsquo;s body is more slender. His skin is slippery.
It is not dull and dingy like that of the toad. It is of
a bright greenish yellow colour, marked with black spots
of different sizes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The frog can change his colour from light to dark.
He has long hind legs which enable him to hop very
high on land and to swim very fast in the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He likes the long, damp grass, where he catches
flies, beetles, and slugs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sleeps through the winter, buried in the mud
at the bottom of the still pool.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like the toad, the frog catches his prey by means
of a long, sticky tongue, which darts out of his mouth
whenever an unlucky insect comes within reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His tongue is fixed to the floor of his mouth just
at his lower lip. It is forked at the end. When not
in use, it lies folded back inside his mouth and points
down his throat.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c11">XI.&mdash;UNDERGROUND STEMS.</h2>
<p>Uncle George and his three young pupils had been
to the woods. After tea he opened the metal box which
he carried, slung by a strap over his shoulder, whenever
he went out rambling.</p>
<p>This box had in it a pond-net and a couple of wide
bottles. To-night it was half filled with plants.</p>
<p>Before laying them on the table, Uncle George
washed the soil from their roots at the tap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let me see how much you
remember of our lesson in the woods. I will begin
with Dolly&rdquo;&mdash;and Uncle George held up a lovely white
flower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said little Dolly, &ldquo;is the <i>wooden enemy</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George laughed loudly, and so did the two
boys. Dolly laughed too&mdash;she did not quite know why.
She was a merry little girl, who laughed whenever she
got the chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean <i>wood anemone</i>, dear, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said
Uncle George, as he stroked her pretty curly hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I <i>mean</i> that, Uncle George; but I can&rsquo;t say it
properly,&rdquo; said Dolly, still laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, you can if you try&mdash;wood a-nem&acute;-o-ne. It
is easily pronounced. Now Frank, it is your turn.
What is this one with the great number of yellow
petals, the spotted heart-shaped leaves, and the funny
fat roots?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;The pilewort, or lesser celandine,&rdquo; answered Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right! Now, Tom, here is one for you.
This plant, you see, has broad kidney-shaped leaves
with crimped edges, large yellow flowers, and a coarse
round hollow stem. We found it, if you remember,
growing in the mud at the edge of the brook.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig28">
<img src="images/illus69.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="592" />
<p class="caption">Marsh Marigold.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is the marsh marigold,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good! Now this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he held it up all three answered at once&mdash;&ldquo;The
primrose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found this one also growing at the edge of
the brook.&rdquo; As he spoke, Uncle George held out a
very pretty plant. Its flowers were of a pale pinkish
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
blue colour. They were shaped like the flowers of the
wallflower, but were smaller. The flowers were borne
up upon a long stalk which sprang from a rosette of
pretty little leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the <i>lady&rsquo;s smock</i>,&rdquo; said Dolly; &ldquo;I remembered
that one because it is so pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, Dolly!&rdquo; said her uncle proudly. &ldquo;Now,
I think we have quite enough to go on with. Let us
take these up one by one and examine and draw parts
of them. First take the wood anemone. What do you
call this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George pointed to the stout part of the plant
that had been in the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The root,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Frank!&rdquo; his uncle replied. &ldquo;But that is what
I thought you would say. Now, tell us why you think
it is the root.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it grows under ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But roots do not have buds upon them, Frank: and
see! flower-stalk and leaf-stalk spring from it, while
fibrous, or string like, roots hang down from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a stem, then,&rdquo; Frank ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> the stem,&rdquo; said his uncle. &ldquo;We have already
seen that the creeping crowfoot and ground ivy have
stems that creep along on the surface of the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many plants have stems which creep along under
ground. This is an underground stem; and this is
another.&rdquo; Here he pointed to the primrose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I always thought that that pink thing was
the root of the primrose,&rdquo; said Frank; &ldquo;but I see now
that it is really more like a stem. It has marks upon
it like scars.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;These are marks where leaves once grew upon it,&rdquo;
his uncle remarked. &ldquo;Notice that the primrose leaves
form a rosette on the top of this underground
stem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any reason for these plants having their
stems under ground?&rdquo; Tom
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a reason for
everything in nature, my boy.
Can&rsquo;t you see any reason for
this yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see one, I think,&rdquo; said
Frank; &ldquo;it enables the plant
to creep out to new soil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is one very good
reason, Frank. Now, why
should it seek other soil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For food!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is right, Frank.
Those plants which have
underground stems seem to
die down every autumn; but
they are alive all the time under ground, safe from
the frosts and bitter winds which kill tender plants.
And they peep up in a new place in spring.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig31">
<img src="images/illus75.jpg" alt="" width="331" height="499" />
<p class="caption">Anemone.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now I want you to tell me why these underground
stems are swollen out so. It cannot be for strength,
for creeping stems don&rsquo;t require to be strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fetch me a raw potato, Tom, please!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Uncle George continued, &ldquo;tell me what this
potato is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an underground stem,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Why is it swollen? What do we use the
potato for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For food. Oh, I know,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;it is a
food store.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig32">

<p class="caption">Pilewort, showing Roots.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said his uncle. &ldquo;It is a supply of food
gathered up this year for next year&rsquo;s plant. Look at
the roots of the lesser celandine. I see Tom has drawn
them. They are swollen. Are they roots, or underground
stems?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have neither leaf marks on them, nor buds,&rdquo;
said Frank, &ldquo;I think they must be roots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They <i>are</i> roots,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;but they are
food supplies all the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are other underground stems that grow
quickly. Good examples of these are mint, couch grass,
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
and sand sedge. The underground stems of these
plants grow so fast that they are always occupying
new ground. They have therefore no need to store up
a food supply like their slower growing neighbours
the primrose, potato, anemone, iris, and many others.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Exercises on Lesson XI.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. Dig up a primrose plant, and make a rough sketch showing underground stem, roots, and leaves.</dt>
<dt>2. An underground stem may be of use to a plant in three different ways. Can you name them?</dt>
<dt>3. There are two distinct kinds of underground stems&mdash;those that grow quickly and those that grow slowly. Name three of each kind, and tell how they differ in shape.</dt>
<dt>4. Compare a potato with a horse-chestnut twig. Supposing your twig to be swollen out with plant-food, what parts of it do the &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; of the potato represent? What do the {scars/marks} near the &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; represent?</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c12">XII.&mdash;CATERPILLARS.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;We found these upon the dead-nettle.&rdquo; As he
spoke, Frank opened a small cardboard box and
showed his uncle half a dozen large, hairy caterpillars.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig34">
<img src="images/illus78.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="262" />
<p class="caption">Larva Cage.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;We will just put
these into the cage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George, who was a very good carpenter, had
of late been busy in his spare time making a box or
cage for keeping caterpillars in. He called it a <i>larva
cage</i>.</p>
<p>It was a curious looking thing, something like a
small meat-safe. Three sides and the top of it were
covered with gauze. The fourth side was a large pane
of glass. The gauze-covered side opposite to this
opened as a door.</p>
<p>It was divided into an upper and a lower part by
a shelf in the middle, and, by sliding in two pieces of
wood, it could be divided into four tiny rooms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Now that it was finished, Uncle George wanted to
get it stocked, and his two nephews wanted it stocked
too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want any more of these woolly caterpillars?&rdquo;
Frank asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Frank, but you can bring me in some more
of a different kind. Or, better still, let us go out into
the garden now and see if we can find any there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gardener beamed with joy when Uncle George
told him what they had come to the garden for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caterpillars?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wish you would take
them all, sir. They are the worst vermin in the garden.
Last year they left scarcely a leaf on my currant
bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our three friends went straight to the currant
bushes. Here they found a good many pretty little
caterpillars of a creamy colour, richly striped with
orange, and dotted over with black spots. These,
their uncle informed them, were the caterpillars or
<i>larv&aelig;</i> of the magpie moth.</p>
<p>On the cabbages they found several caterpillars of
the large white butterfly. These were bluish green in
colour, with three bold yellow stripes running along
the whole length of their bodies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are these, Uncle George?&rdquo; Tom asked, as
he turned up a cabbage leaf and pointed to several
white patches on its under side. The leaf next it was
spotted just like it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom, how lucky we are! These are the eggs
of the large white butterfly. Now we shall be able to
follow up the whole life of this insect, and a wonderful
life it is. Let us go right in and examine them. Take
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
some cabbage leaves and some currant leaves to feed
the hungry caterpillars with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our larva cage is now quite full,&rdquo; said Uncle
George, when he had put the caterpillars in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you not put them into the same room,
Uncle George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two reasons for that, Frank. First,
they live upon different kinds
of food. The hairy caterpillar,
or &lsquo;woolly bear,&rsquo; as boys call it,
feeds upon nettles, the cabbage
caterpillar prefers cabbage leaves,
while the currant caterpillar will
only eat currant leaves.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig35">
<img src="images/illus80.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="406" />
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Caterpillar and Eggs of Cabbage Butterfly.</dt>
<dt>2. Egg magnified.</dt></dl>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Second, the woolly bear will
sometimes eat up his smooth-skinned
friends. Now, get your
glasses and have a peep at the
beautiful eggs of the &lsquo;large
white&rsquo; or &lsquo;cabbage&rsquo; butterfly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they are not at all like eggs,&rdquo; said Frank, as
he closely looked at them with his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they like, Frank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are like little pieces of carved ivory all
shaped alike,&rdquo; Frank replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that does not give us a very clear idea
of their shape,&rdquo; observed his uncle. &ldquo;Come on,
Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are like little Indian clubs with the handles
cut off, only they are beautifully marked with long,
slender ridges and cross bars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is really a very good account of them, Tom.
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
They are arranged in patches. Count and let me know
how many eggs are in each bunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys counted all the groups of eggs, and found
that there were eight eggs in some, nine in others, but
that most of them contained ten or more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, how many egg patches are there?&rdquo; asked
Uncle George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are seven patches on my leaf,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ten on mine,&rdquo; added Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is about one hundred and fifty eggs altogether,&rdquo;
said Uncle George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has each of these bunches of eggs been laid by
one butterfly?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is more than probable that one butterfly laid
the whole lot,&rdquo; his uncle replied; &ldquo;for the white butterfly
lays, as a rule, over two hundred eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is about as many eggs as a hen lays in a
year,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;a good hen and a white
butterfly lay about the same number of eggs in a year;
but the butterfly lays all her eggs in one day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After laying her eggs, she dies. That is perhaps
why she always lays them on the kind of plant which
the young caterpillars can feed upon when they hatch
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us look at the caterpillars now. We need not
take them out, as we can easily see them through the
glass side of the cage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notice that the body of the cabbage caterpillar
consists of a round, dark coloured head and a number
of broad, ring-like divisions. How many of these
divisions are there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve,&rdquo; said Frank, after counting carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; said his uncle. &ldquo;Now, about legs&mdash;how
many are there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are three pairs of legs on the first three
divisions of its body, and a pair of shorter and stouter
legs on each of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth
divisions, making seven pairs of legs altogether,&rdquo; Frank
answered.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig36">
<img src="images/illus82.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="501" />
<p class="caption">Caterpillars of Magpie Moth.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is quite correct, Frank,
and I am glad you noticed the
difference between the first three
pairs and the others. The first
three pairs are the creature&rsquo;s real
legs. The others are false or temporary
legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a row of black spots
on the yellow band along its side,&rdquo;
observed Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are its breathing-holes,
Tom. We breathe by our lungs only, but caterpillars
and insects have breathing-tubes all over their bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woolly bear and the cabbage caterpillar move
about in the same way,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;But look at
those currant caterpillars, Uncle George, what a
funny way they have of getting along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These belong to a kind of caterpillars known as
&lsquo;loopers,&rsquo;&rdquo; said his uncle. &ldquo;They move about by looping
up their bodies in this strange manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not like to handle those hairy caterpillars,&rdquo;
Tom remarked. &ldquo;Why are they covered with those
nasty long hairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have just given the reason, Tom. You don&rsquo;t
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
like to touch them on account of these hairs; neither
do animals. No bird will eat one of these. If he does,
he will never eat another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notice how they coil up like a hedgehog when they
are touched. This makes them more difficult to
swallow. Just imagine how a bird would feel with one
of these ticklish customers stuck in his throat, eh?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys, make a sketch of one of the tiny eggs,
also one of the big cabbage caterpillar, and then we
will go out and have a game of cricket on the lawn.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c13">XIII.&mdash;THE WHITE BUTTERFLY.</h2>
<p>Uncle George had to go from home for a week, and
his two nephews went part of the way to the railway
station with him.</p>
<p>As they were about to take a short cut through the
wood, Uncle George went up to a huge beech tree.
He looked very closely at its grey trunk for a time, then
stepping back from it about three yards, exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here boys! Stand beside me, look closely
at this tree, and tell me if you see any strange objects
sticking to the bark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After staring at it for some time, they both declared
that they could see nothing upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go nearer&mdash;nearer still! Now, do you see anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go quite close up to the trunk and examine it,&rdquo; said
Uncle George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Frank suddenly, &ldquo;I see queer things like
grubs, coloured almost exactly like the bark. Some of
them are lighter in colour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look carefully at those lighter ones, and you will
find that they are just empty cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they are,&rdquo; said Frank, as he touched one with
his finger and saw it crush up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notice how they are fixed to the bark!&rdquo; said
Uncle George.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>The boys watched as their uncle placed his pencil
under one of the darker coloured objects, and saw that
it was slung up to the tree by a loose silken girdle
round its middle, while a tuft of fine threads fastened
the lower end to the bark.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as if it were annoyed at being touched
by the pencil, the lower half of the object moved from
side to side with rapid jerks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it is alive,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course it is,&rdquo; said his uncle. &ldquo;This is
another lucky find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; Frank asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess, Frank? Don&rsquo;t you remember my
telling you that all the insects were asleep in their
cases during winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each of these darker coloured cases contains a white
butterfly. They have been here all winter, and they are
just about to hatch out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that, Uncle George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it because the empty cases tell me that
some of the butterflies have just hatched out. This is
what your cabbage caterpillar becomes after he is tired
of feeding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have now seen three different stages of the life
of this insect. First, the curious eggs laid on the under
side of the cabbage leaf; next the greedy caterpillar;
and now, the chrysalis or <i>pupa</i> stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The caterpillar goes to sleep in autumn as a hard-cased
chrysalis, and wakes up in spring a beautiful
butterfly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;And will our caterpillars
remain caterpillars until autumn, and then tuck
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
themselves up like this and go to sleep for the
winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Frank! our caterpillars will go into the chrysalis
state in a week or so, and hatch out as butterflies in
August. These August butterflies will lay eggs. The
caterpillars from these eggs will turn into <i>pup&aelig;</i> in
September.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These September pup&aelig; will supply the white butterflies
of next spring and summer. Put some of these
into your box. Watch then carefully, and you may be
lucky enough to see the white butterfly coming out of
his winter case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot understand,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;how a big white
butterfly can be inside so small a case. It must be very
tightly wrapped up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is, as you will see,&rdquo; said Uncle George.
&ldquo;Good-bye, boys! and mind, when I come back, I shall
expect to see notes and sketches of all that has taken
place in the larva cage during my absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you let your uncle take his dinner first,&rdquo;
said Frank&rsquo;s mother, as she hung Uncle George&rsquo;s
overcoat up in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mother! he must come at once,&rdquo; said the
excited Frank. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a butterfly just coming out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I must come and see that,&rdquo; said Uncle George;
and he allowed his eager nephews to drag him towards
the larva cage.</p>
<p>By the time they got to the cage the butterfly had
hatched, but they were in time to see it unfurl its wings.
The wings were crumpled and twisted, but the creature
slowly straightened them out to dry in the sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;We saw it burst its case,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;First a
small slit appeared at the head end. This slit grew
larger. Then the butterfly&rsquo;s head and feet appeared.
It squeezed its way and was just half way out, with its
wings crumpled round it, when you arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I arrived just a minute too late, then,&rdquo; said his
uncle.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig37">
<img src="images/illus87.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="338" />
<p class="caption">White or Cabbage Butterfly and Pupa.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, and the eggs have hatched too,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;Look at them now, Uncle George!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His uncle looked, and saw that the white patches
of eggs had given place to larger patches of little active,
dark coloured maggots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to know what has become of the lovely
carved shells of the eggs,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have been eaten up,&rdquo; his uncle replied.
&ldquo;From the moment a caterpillar is born he does nothing
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
but eat&mdash;eat&mdash;eat. He begins by eating the shell of
the egg he comes out of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the first week of their lives these tiny caterpillars
feed together in small bands, and they grow so
fast you can almost fancy you see them growing.
After they have grown to a certain size, each caterpillar
starts out for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see the three butterflies that have hatched
out?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see them. There are two females and one
male,&rdquo; said Uncle George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you tell males from females?&rdquo; asked
Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is easy enough,&rdquo; Uncle George replied.
&ldquo;The females are larger, and have two big black spots
on each of their front wings. But I only see eight of
the large cabbage caterpillars. We put in twelve,
I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Frank, pointing to the roof of the
cage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, I see them. Two of them have passed into
the pup&aelig; stage, and are slung up by their silken belts
to the wall of the cage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other two are spinning silken belts round the
middle of their bodies, if they have not already done so.
After this belt is finished they will slowly slip their
useless green skins off, and finally get rid of them by
sharply jerking the tail end of their pupa cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we watched those other two do that,&rdquo; said
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notice,&rdquo; continued Uncle George, &ldquo;that all your
big cabbage caterpillars have lost their yellow stripes
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
and are now of a bluish green colour. They have
stopped feeding, and are now dull and sleepy. This
indicates that they are about to enter the pupa stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look at the currant and the hairy caterpillars,
uncle,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; said Frank&rsquo;s mother, &ldquo;Uncle George
must really have food and rest after his long journey.
He will hear about the other caterpillars some other
time.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Exercises on Lesson XIII.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. Explain why the pup&aelig; of white butterflies are coloured like the objects they are attached to.</dt>
<dt>2. Write the life of a white butterfly, and illustrate your description with sketches of caterpillar, pupa, and butterfly.</dt>
<dt>3. The life of an insect is divided into four distinct stages. Name them. Which is the longest stage in the case of the white butterfly?</dt>
<dt>4. Describe, as you have observed it, the behaviour of a caterpillar as it passes from the larva to the chrysalis form.</dt></dl>

<h2 id="c14">XIV.&mdash;THE TOILING CADDIS.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, boys,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;you have
been paying nearly all your attention to the larva cage
during my absence, and have forgotten the caddis
worms.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig38">

<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Caddis Cases.</dt>
<dt>2. Larva out of Case.</dt>
<dt>3. Pupa.</dt>
<dt>4. Caddis Fly.</dt></dl>
</div>
<p>Uncle George made believe to be cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We changed the water every two days,&rdquo; said
Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. But you have not reported any
changes in the creatures themselves. What has been
going on in the larva cage has also been going on
here in the water, for caddis worms are simply water-caterpillars.
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
You nearly missed something of very great
interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George laid three saucers on the table, and
continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to look into the life of the caddis
fly to-day; but before I take them out of the water, I
want you to tell me what you have noted about them
up to now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are always climbing up the water weeds,&rdquo;
said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are always adding to their cases,&rdquo; said
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of them have died,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said his uncle. &ldquo;Do you mean these at
the bottom of the tank? These are not dead, they
are only asleep. Put your hand in, and take some of
these out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their cases are stuck to the pond weeds and to
each other,&rdquo; said Frank, as he lifted a few out, and
placed them in a saucer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I have it, Uncle George! They have gone into
the pupa state. Is that not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom. &ldquo;There are things like
earwigs floating on the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind these just now, Tom,&rdquo; said his uncle.
&ldquo;I am coming to them by and by. Observe the
wonderful cases which the caddis worms have made
for themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is one whose case, when we found him, was
made of neatly cut pieces of water rush. He has
almost doubled the length of his case since then; for
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
see, the front half is made of cut stalks of water weed
neatly arranged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has got a fine collar of green pieces round
his neck,&rdquo; Frank observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are they always adding to the length of their
cases?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they are always growing,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the reason,&rdquo; said Uncle George; &ldquo;and they
grow so fast that they have actually to work hard at
building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Observe those that make their cases out of tiny
shells and stones. They have made free use of the
coloured beads and small pieces of coal which we
put in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do they manage to stick these things
together?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A caddis worm is a busy creature,&rdquo; his uncle
replied. &ldquo;He does two things besides eating and growing.
With those strong pincers, which you see at his
head, he saws off pieces of weed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near his mouth he has got a kind of loom for
spinning silk. These pieces are stuck together with
silk, which is a gluey substance when it first comes
from the creature&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These rough cases are lined with silk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does he have to make a house for himself,
and carry it about with him?&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>In answer to this, his uncle took out a few of the
active caddis worms, and placed them in a saucer with
water. He held one up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;his case is open at both
ends. Now, if I tried to get him out from the front,
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
I should never manage it. This is the way to get
him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Uncle George pushed the head of a
pin into the tail end of the case, and the creature
scrambled out at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too bad turning you out of your cosy room,
Mr Caddis,&rdquo; Uncle George observed; &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll go
back again as soon as you get the chance, won&rsquo;t you?
I want my nephews to understand why you work so
very hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Frank, you can answer your own question,
I think&mdash;&lsquo;Why does the caddis worm build a house?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he has a soft body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right. But why is he forced to protect his
body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fishes would eat him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right again, Frank. If trout could speak, they
might tell you that the sweetest morsel in the stream
is the caddis worm. Now, take your lens, please, and
tell me something about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His body is divided into rings, and there are the
same number of them as we found in the caterpillar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Frank. Now give Tom a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His head and the first three divisions of his body
are hard cased. They are black and yellow in
colour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has six legs,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;and they are
attached to the first three divisions of his body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the last division of his body?&rdquo; Uncle
George asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how funny!&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;It is divided into
two large things like horns.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;These,&rdquo; said his uncle, &ldquo;are the hooks by which
he fixes himself so firmly in his case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are all these curious big bristles for?&rdquo;
asked Tom. &ldquo;They are all over his body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are his breathing organs,&rdquo; Uncle George
answered. &ldquo;The caterpillar, if you remember, had
breathing-holes along the sides of his body. By moving
his long body, the caddis worm causes a constant
current of water to pass through his dwelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the fourth segment of his body. How
does it differ from the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the broadest segment,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;and
there is a stout rounded thing in the middle
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; his uncle replied, &ldquo;and if we can get him
turned on his back we shall see two more of these
stout outgrowths below, one on each side of the same
segment. This is really very clever. By it the animal
keeps himself in the middle, so that the current of
water must flow all around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look at the case of a sleeping caddis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The front of the case is closed,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it closed, Frank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there is a network of threads over it,&rdquo;
answered Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; you see a caddis worm cannot do without
fresh water, even when he is asleep; so, before going
to sleep, he builds a grating over the entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he wakes up, he has quite a new shape
altogether. And this brings us to those things which
Tom said were like &lsquo;earwigs.&rsquo; There are five of them
floating on the water, and two of these are dead. If
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
you look, you will find five empty caddis cases in the
tank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does he get out of the case?&rdquo; inquired Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easily enough. Look at the strong pair of pincers
he has got for cutting his way through the silken
grating with. No longer burdened with his heavy case,
he floats up to the surface. He crawls up out of the
water into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there are no rushes or floating leaves about, he
is sure to drown; for your caddis is no longer a water
insect, but a fly inside a thin skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys, I am going to show you something
wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George then took out the three living pup&aelig;
that were floating on the water, and placed them on
the table. The boys watched them for a long time.</p>
<p>They were beginning to get impatient, when suddenly
the skin of one of the creatures burst along the back,
and a lovely little fly, with brown, gauzy wings and
long feelers, came out.</p>
<p>After airing its wings for about a minute, it flew
to the window. The other two acted in just the same
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear boys, I think you know something
about the life of the caddis fly. For a whole year of
his life he is a crawling water insect, then, for about
a single day, he is a lively fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does the caddis larva first get into the
water?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an egg, Frank. The female caddis fly lays her
eggs in the water. She sometimes even crawls down
right into the water to lay them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;A tiny caddis grub, no bigger than this pin-head,
comes out of each egg. As soon as he hatches out,
he begins to build his case, to eat, and to grow; and
from the moment of his birth up to the closing up of
his tube, he is scarcely a moment idle.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Exercises on Lesson XIV.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. Turn a caddis worm out of his case in the way described in the lesson. Place the insect in a saucer half filled with water, and make a rough sketch of it.</dt>
<dt>2. When you have finished your sketch, place the empty caddis case in the saucer, and watch how the creature gets into it.</dt>
<dt>3. Make two columns by drawing a line down the centre of a page of your note-book. In the first column, describe the structure of the caddis larva and fly; in the second, that of the cabbage caterpillar and butterfly. Compare them.</dt>
<dt>4. In the same way describe the <i>mode of life</i> of the caddis fly (Column 1), and of the white butterfly (Column 2).</dt></dl>

<h2 id="c15">APPENDIX.
<br />HINTS TO TEACHERS.</h2>
<p><b>BUDS.</b>&mdash;Twigs of beech, horse-chestnut, lilac, and hawthorn ought to
be taken in in December and placed in water. They should have as much
warmth and light as possible.</p>
<p>Willow twigs (for catkins) might also be forced in this way.</p>
<p><b>SEEDS.</b>&mdash;Seeds should be soaked for twenty-four hours and then
sown in sawdust in boxes 4 inches deep. They should be sown in
presence of the pupils.</p>
<p>In winter these boxes should be kept on the hot pipes in school. The
sawdust should not be allowed to get dry, neither should it be deluged with
water, but kept evenly moist if possible.</p>
<p>Be careful to use water <i>not colder than the temperature of the room</i>
in which the seeds are grown. Nothing checks growth more effectively
than chilling with icy-cold water. It is a good plan to keep the watering-pan
full of water near the hot pipes, refilling it always after use.</p>
<p>Seeds germinate best in the dark, but whenever the plumule shows above
the sawdust, the box containing them should be placed in the light.
Sufficient seeds should be sown at one time to supply a plant to each pupil
once a week for at least four weeks. A number of seeds or plants should be
dug up once a week and sketched by the children. Each sketch should be
compared with that of the previous week, and all changes duly noted down.</p>
<p>The best seeds to grow are:&mdash;Broad bean, common or &ldquo;large white&rdquo;
maize, runner bean (&ldquo;Painted Lady&rdquo;), French bean, kitchen pea
(&ldquo;Stratagem&rdquo;), and white mustard.</p>
<p>A few seeds of white mustard should be sprinkled on a small piece of
moist blotting-paper, and covered over by a small glass bell-jar or an
inverted tumbler. In less than a week the root-hairs may be seen.</p>
<p>If hot-water pipes are available, the following seeds should be grown,
as their germination is interesting:&mdash;date stones, walnuts, chestnuts,
almonds, cherry stones, orange pips, seeds of cucumber and sunflower.</p>
<p>After maize and bean (or pea) plants have reached the height of
5 inches, they should be transferred to bottles of tap water&mdash;as described
at the end of Lesson VI.&mdash;and the continuous growth sketched and
noted from week to week.</p>
<p><b>POND AND DITCH HUNTING.</b>&mdash;Make a ring of stout brass wire
about 8 or 10 inches in diameter, and to this attach a bag net made of
mosquito netting not more than 9 inches deep. In making the wire
ring, leave attached to it about 5 inches of the twisted ends of the wire.
Such a net as this can be easily carried and quickly attached to the
end of a walking-stick by means of a piece of string.</p>
<p>The best &ldquo;finds&rdquo; are often made by sweeping the net under banks
and among pond weeds.</p>
<p><b>FROG SPAWN.</b>&mdash;Frog spawn is abundant in ponds and ditches
everywhere in March. It should be kept immersed in as much water
as possible in a large vessel, preferably of glass. Whenever the water
show signs of fouling, it should be changed; but, as changing water
containing tadpoles is somewhat difficult, the fewer changes the better.</p>
<p>As in the case of seed growing, the development of the tadpole
should be learnt by weekly sketches and notes.</p>
<p><b>NEWTS.</b>&mdash;Newts can be taken with the gauze-net or in the following
way:&mdash;Tie a piece of small worm on to the end of a cotton thread
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
fastened to the end of a willow or hazel switch. Cast into the part
of the pond where the newts are, and await results.</p>
<p>Live newts, fish, frog spawn, etc., may be obtained from Messrs
Willson, Live Stock Providers, 37 New Oxford Street, London; Thomas
Bolton, 25 Balsall Heath Road, Birmingham, and other dealers. Newts
should be fed once a day on pieces of small worms.</p>
<p><b>CATERPILLARS.</b>&mdash;Caterpillars and pup&aelig;, if not obtainable in local
woods, fields, and gardens, can be had from Messrs Watkins &amp; Doncaster,
36 Strand, London, and others.</p>
<p><b>CADDIS LARV&AElig;.</b>&mdash;Caddis worms are to be found in almost every
stream, pond, and ditch. Most of them are vegetable feeders: therefore
a plentiful supply of water weeds should be placed in their tank.
Carnivorous caddis worms may be fed on small pieces of raw meat.
(See Stickle-backs.)</p>
<p><b>STICKLE-BACKS.</b>&mdash;Stickle-backs are common in canals and streams.
They are easily caught with the net. They should be fed once a day
on grated biscuit, and occasionally on raw meat. The meat should be
chopped very fine, and then pressed through a piece of perforated zinc.
Very little food suffices. If too much is put in, the residue should be removed
by means of a glass tube, as described in Lesson IX., p. 56. If no green
water plants are obtainable, the water should be changed at least every
second day by means of a siphon. Once a month is quite often enough if
sufficient green plants are kept in the tank and decaying matter carefully
removed. Do not over-stock&mdash;few fishes and much water is the rule.</p>
<p><b>WATER PLANTS.</b>&mdash;It is best to take the water plants which are
found growing locally. The following are fairly common:&mdash;<i>Elodea canadensis</i>,
water millfoil; <i>Potamogeton</i> (<i>nitens</i>, <i>crispus</i>, or <i>filiformis</i>),
&ldquo;water soldier&rdquo;; <i>Vallisneria spiralis</i>, <i>Chara</i>, <i>Nitella</i>, water star-wort
and watercress. A good selection of excellent aquarium plants are advertised
at a cheap rate by the Solway Fishery Co., Dumfries. Water
plants, if not rooted in the tank, should be renewed occasionally.</p>
<p><b>LARV&AElig; CAGE.</b>&mdash;Take four square pieces (about 1&frac12; inches square)
of wood, each a foot long, and nail or screw them upright into the four
corners of a square piece of &frac34;-inch deal measuring a foot each way.
Stretch mosquito netting over sides, end, and top, arranging that one side
can be opened. This can be managed by fastening the last fold of
netting to one of the upright posts by three drawing-pins. Fresh
leaves should be supplied daily. For those caterpillars which pupate in
the soil, a shallow earthenware flower-pot&mdash;known in the trade as a
&ldquo;seed-pan&rdquo;&mdash;should be supplied. The seed-pan should be filled with
soil, the pup&aelig; placed on the surface, and a layer of moss placed over
them. Once a week the moss should be dipped in water, squeezed
almost dry, and replaced on the pup&aelig;.</p>
<p><b>AQUARIUM.</b>&mdash;Procure from a local florist or seedsman what is
known as a &ldquo;propagating bell.&rdquo; These cost from 1s. up to 2s. 6d. A
block of wood 12 inches square and 4 or 5 inches in thickness is also
required. Bore a hole about 2 inches in diameter right through the
centre of the block, to hold the knob of the bell. Then, with a gouge
chisel, make a saucer-shaped hollow round the hole, to roughly fit the
rounded end of the bell. Before fitting the bell into the block, interpose
a thin layer of moss.</p>
<p>This makes an excellent aquarium&mdash;elegant and serviceable. Keep
the aquarium in a window, but shade it from bright sunlight.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
